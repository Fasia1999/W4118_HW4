Scheduler Testing:
=================

We tested our scheduler from user land as we were able to get to work there. So essentially, the environment we created was the following: 5 infinite loop do nothing programs with a weight of 10, and then 1 prime factorization program with varibale weights. 

The number we choose to factor was 1234567 because it took resonably well running on the Nexus 7 device (not too short or too long). 

The results of testing are presented below: 

Trial 1: T
